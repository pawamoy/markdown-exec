# Usage

Once the extension is configured (see README/Overview),
you can execute code blocks by enabling the `exec` option:

````md
```python exec="on"
print("Hello Markdown!")
```
````

The `exec` option will be true for every possible value
except `0`, `no`, `off` and `false` (case insensitive).

## HTML vs. Markdown

By default, Markdown Exec will render what you print as Markdown.
If you want to skip rendering, to inject HTML directly,
you can set the `html` option to true.

HTML Example:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
System information:

```python exec="true" html="true"
--8<-- "usage/platform_html.py"
```
````

Markdown Example:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
System information:

```python exec="true"
--8<-- "usage/platform_md.py"
```
````

## Generated headings in Table of Contents

If you are using Python Markdown's `toc` extension,
or writing docs with MkDocs, you will notice that the headings
you generated by executing a code block appear in the table of contents.
If you don't want those headings to appear in the ToC, you can use
the `updatetoc="no"` boolean option:

````md
```python exec="1" updatetoc="no"
print("# XL heading\n")
print("## L heading\n")
print("### M heading\n")
print("#### S heading\n")
```
````

## Render the source code as well

It's possible to render both the result of the executed code block
*and* the code block itself. For this, use the `source` option
with one of the following values:

- `above`: The source code will be rendered above the result.
- `below`: The source code will be rendered below the result.
- `material-block`: The source code and result will be wrapped in a nice-looking block (only works with Material for MkDocs).
- `tabbed-left`: The source code and result will be rendered in tabs, in that order (remember to enable the `pymdownx.tabbed` extension).
- `tabbed-right`: The result and source code will be rendered in tabs, in that order (remember to enable the `pymdownx.tabbed` extension).
- `console`: The source and result are concatenated in a single code block, like an interactive console session.

**Source above:**

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="true" source="above"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

---

**Source below:**

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="true" source="below"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

---

**Material block:**

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="true" source="material-block"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

---

**Tabbed on the left:**

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

---

**Tabbed on the right:**

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="true" source="tabbed-right"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

---

**Console** <small>(best used with actual session syntax like
[`pycon`](python/#python-console-code) or [`console`](shell/#console))</small>:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```pycon exec="true" source="console"
--8<-- "usage/source.pycon"
```
````

## Hiding lines from the source

Every line that contains the string `markdown-exec: hide` will be hidden from the
displayed source.

=== "Markdown"
    ````md
    ```python exec="true" source="above"
    --8<-- "usage/hide.py"
    ```
    ````

=== "Rendered"
    ```python exec="true" source="above"
    --8<-- "usage/hide.py"
    ```

## Change the titles of tabs

In the previous example, we didn't specify any title for tabs,
so Markdown Exec used "Source" and "Result" by default.
You can customize the titles with the `tabs` option:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Source code|Output"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

As you can see, titles are separated with a pipe `|`. Both titles are stripped
so you can add space around the pipe. If you need to use that character in a title,
simply escape it with `\|`:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="OR operator: a \|\| b | Boolean matrix"
--8<-- "usage/boolean_matrix.py"
```
````

IMPORTANT: The `tabs` option ***always*** expects the "Source" tab title first,
and the "Result" tab title second. It allows to switch from tabbed-left
to tabbed-right and inversely without having to switch the titles as well.


WARNING: **Limitation**  
Changing the title for only one tab is not supported.

## Wrap result in a code block

You can wrap the result in a code block by specifying a code block language:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```console exec="1" result="json"
$ pdm info --env
```
````

WARNING: **Limitation**  
Wrapping the result is not possible when HTML output is enabled.

## Additional options

If you are using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/),
you are probably familiar with the `title` option on code blocks:

````md
```python title="setup.py"
from setuptools import setup
setup(...)
```
````

Markdown Exec will add back these unrecognized options
when rendering the source, so you can keep using them normally.

Example:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left" tabs="Markdown|Rendered"
```python exec="1" source="above" title="source.py"
--8<-- "usage/source.py"
```
````

## Handling errors

Code blocks execution can fail.
For example, your Python code may raise exceptions,
or your shell code may return a non-zero exit code
(for shell commands that are expected to return non-zero,
see [Expecting a non-zero exit code](shell/#expecting-a-non-zero-exit-code)).

In these cases, the exception and traceback (Python),
or the current output (shell) will be rendered
instead of the result, and a warning will be logged.

Example of failing code:

````md
```python exec="true"
print("hello")
assert 1 + 1 == 11
```
````

```text title="MkDocs output"
WARNING  -  markdown_exec: Execution of python code block exited with errors
```

```python title="Rendered traceback"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/markdown_exec/formatters/python.py", line 23, in _run_python
    exec(code, exec_globals)  # noqa: S102
  File "<executed code block>", line 2, in <module>
    assert 1 + 1 == 11
AssertionError
```

With many executed code blocks in your docs,
it will be hard to know which code block failed exactly.
To make it easier, you can set an ID on each code block
with the `id` option, and this ID will be shown in the logs:

````md
```python exec="true" id="print hello"
print("hello")
assert 1 + 1 == 11
```
````

```text title="MkDocs output"
WARNING  -  markdown_exec: Execution of python code block 'print hello' exited with errors
```

> TIP: **Titles act as IDs as well!**  
> You *don't need* to provide an ID
> if you already set a (Material for MkDocs) title:
>
> ````md
> ```python exec="true" title="print world"
> print("world")
> assert 1 + 1 == 11
> ```
> ````
>
> ```text title="MkDocs output"
> WARNING  -  markdown_exec: Execution of python code block 'print world' exited with errors
> ```

## Sessions

Markdown Exec makes it possible to persist state between executed code blocks.
To persist state and reuse it in other code blocks, give a session name to your blocks:

````md exec="1" source="material-block" title="Sessions"
```python exec="1" session="greet"
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

Hello Mushu!

```python exec="1" session="greet"
greet("Ping")
```
````

WARNING: **Limitation**  
Sessions only work with Python and Pycon syntax for now.

## Literate Markdown

With this extension, it is also possible to write "literate programming" Markdown.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming):

> Literate programming (LP) tools are used to obtain two representations from a source file:
  one understandable by a compiler or interpreter, the "tangled" code,
  and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be "woven" from the literate source.

We effectively support executing multiple *nested* code blocks to generate complex output.
That makes for a very meta-markdown markup:

````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left"
```md exec="1" source="material-block" title="Markdown link"
[Link to example.com](https://example.com)
```
````

> TIP: **So power, such meta**  
> The above example (both tabs) was entirely generated using *a literate code block in a literate code block* 🤯:
> 
> `````md
> ````md exec="1" source="tabbed-left"
> ```md exec="1" source="material-block" title="Markdown link"
> [Link to example.com](https://example.com)
> ```
> ````
> `````
>
> In fact, all the examples on this page were generated using this method!
> Check out the source here: https://github.com/pawamoy/markdown-exec/blob/master/docs/usage/index.md
> (click on "Raw" to see the code blocks execution options).

Of course "executing" Markdown (or rather, making it "literate") only makes sense when the source is shown as well.
